You can copy the code and compile it yourself if you are afraid of an unknown dll file
and transfer the necessary files to the specified path:
Move it first "Rooms3D.dll " to the folder
"C:\Users\<YourUserName>\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\<YourVersionRevit>\"
and then "Rooms3D.addin" to the same place
